                    This web development course has been one of my favorite computer science classes that I have taken at JMU. It was very well adapted to the online environment and informative overall. 
                    While there are many positives about this course, there can always be improvements. If I was designing this course, I will implement the following. 
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Firstly, I'll discuss the positives about this course or things that I would keep the same in my implementation. The two big website and application projects were very good ideas in my opinion.
                    I think that it is very important for computer science students to have concrete and applicable projects that they can show as their work. It makes this major feel "real" and align more closely to the kind of work that they assumely would have to do in industry. 
                    Additionally, college is supposed to further help students get jobs in the future and from my experience of interviewing for jobs, recruiters and interviewers were very impressed by the fact that I had a real website with a real URL and everything. 
                    For the first project in particular, the fact that we had to make a website for a client was a big positive in my opinion. It allowed us to have the creativity that we usually lack from other computer science courses. 
                    Furthermore, learning about client interaction is very important for industry work. I was also a big fan of these weekly blog posts. I think it was really fun for us to have a blog and to be able to explore ideas that we were interested in on our own. 
                    When I was interviewing for jobs, recruiters were very impressed by this blog idea. To them, it facilitates the idea that we are keeping up with the latest technological trends and are willing to learn because we want to. 
                    Additionally, I think this is a "fun" assignment. It doesn't feel as daunting as when we have to submit our Java projects on AutoLab for a grade. 
                    I also was a big fan of using the break out rooms for lab work. Especially since we are online, it allows us to interact with classmates that we don't see anymore. 
                    Also, since it was mainly graded based on participation, it relieved a lot more stress for us to rush to finish something. 
                    Lastly, I think the video lectures were well executed. I think for a course like this, it's hard to just talk about HTML or CSS theoretically, so providing examples and allowing us to follow along with the examples was really nice. 
                    Again, since we are online, I think this is very good given the circumstances. 
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    If I had to change or done anything differently about this course, I would have done the following. I think this was discussed at sometime this semester, but I think this course should be split into two where HTML/CSS/basic JavaScript should be one lower level course while React/Redux/Express etc. is another higher level course. 
                    I believe that we have learned a lot this semester, but the second half of the semester felt more rushed as we tried to cover all of concepts about React/Redux/Express etc. 
                    I think we did hit most of the important points, but I think it would've been nicer for us to slow down and learn more about React/Redux/Express etc. 
                    I think having HTML/CSS/basic JavaScript as a lower level course will allow students to have that creativity earlier on in the major especially when most of their projects at that time are graded by some automatic grading script. 
                    I also think that HTML/CSS/basic JavaScript could be combined with the CS 345 Software Engineering course. That course allowed us to work with Java GUI, which is an important concept to learn, but doesn't feel as applicable in the real world since it's rarely used. 
                    For the higher level React/Redux/Express etc. course, I think it should be a prerequiste to have taken the CS 374 Database course. I'm currently enrolled in Databases right now and it does help me understand more of the backend.
                    Additionally, even though I like the idea of working with others in the break out rooms for the labs, I do think it would've been more beneficial for us if we were forced to individually work and finish it at some point. 
                    It was nice to talk to others about the topics since it was something new - something we just watched in the lecture videos the night before; however, I think that sometimes in those break out rooms, there tends to be several individuals who know or understand the concept better than others. So, they tend to lead the discussion while everyone else follows along. 
                    I'm saying that this is anyone's particular fault, but it's just the idea of group think. It's harder to understand the topics on your own if that's the case. 
                    As an alternative, I think the labs should be due and graded on accuracy. I think we should be able to talk or work on it with 1 or 2 other individuals if we wanted to, but also everyone should submit their work individually so that we make sure that everyone personally understand the topic. 
                    For the lecture videos, I think all of the examples were good and essential, but I think when it comes to React/Redux/Express etc., I wished we spent more time talking about the foundations of the language and how the different functions worked. 
                    For example, for our low level Java courses, we learned how every class made is inherited from the Object class which is why every class technically has an equals method which is again why addresses are compared if it the equals method not overridden. I feel like something like this strengthens our understanding of the language for "the why" of how it works. 
                    In order to do so, I don't think it would a bad idea to assign some readings that highlight more of the why a language works the way it does.
